# My Dota AutoHotkey Scripts (BETA versions)
* These macro scripts are meant to compliment built-in lua scripts within Hake.me, NOT replace them. And if the Hake servers go down, these scripts will always work
## Setup
* I run these macro scripts with Auto Hotkey. You can download the AHK program from [autohotkey.com](https://autohotkey.com         /download/). Further instructions on how to operate this program can be found on [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/)

## These Scripts are Tested Prior to Release to Ensure Compatibility with Foo's AIO and Hake.me Scripts (Read Notes Below)

### Foo's AIO Compatibility Checklist
  My AHK scripts are compatible with the following functions:

* Ward Awareness

* Auto Item Usage (Compatible with the Armlet function)

* Auto Use Utility Items

* Auto Use Defensive Items

* Auto Kill Steal

* Last Hitter (MAKE SURE HOTKEY FOR THE AHK SCRIPTS DO NOT OVERLAP YOUR DESIGNATED LH/DENY HOTKEYS, if so, change necessary hotkeys) Example : You have LH hotkey designated as "d" and my script has a hotkey designated as "d::". If this happens, change one.

* DodgeIt

### Hake.me Compatibility Checklist
  My AHK scripts are compatible with the following functions:

* My scripts are compatible with all of Hake.me Built-In features (Refer to my notes that applies to Hake's Built-In LH feature, as the process will be the same)

### Misc Tested Scripts Compatibility Checklist (Not Responsible if these scripts creators have not updated their core scripts)
* AbilityAlertAdvanced.lua

* AutoDodger2.lua

* AutoDust.lua

* GUI-Courier.lua

* GUI-Treant.lua

* GUI.lua

* HpMpBar.lua

* Treant.lua

* WardPositionTrack.lua

* creepblock.lua

* It is your responsibility to ensure any of these scripts hotkeys you choose to use don't match the hotkeys within my scripts or vice versa.
## How to Change Hotkeys
* Example: In my Oracle script, I have his Damage combo hotkey set as "e::", but you want to change it to "d::". Just delete the "e" and replace it with a "d"
* Following any user-made changes, save, and then reload script
## Concluding Notes
* The scripts are timed according to each heroes specific abilities and recommended items (I used Torte de Lini's builds as my constant variable for the order of ability and item usage)
* This script is meant to provide macro scripts to fill in the gaps for heroes currently not covered by Built-In Hake scripts and Foo's AIO scripts, it is NOT meant to perform as a full lua script such as theirs which is why I test my scripts to ensure they are supported by the logic provided within the scripts listed above
* There is no "Target Locking" logic built into these scripts, they operate by performing the actions towards wherever you cursor is hovering
* I have also provided further, very brief notes/instructions within my scripts
* My scripts were built using Dota's Default Hotkey Setup as a template, so please do not get confused with the "NumPad", "Space" and "Tab" keybinds. They work.
* Feel free to change the hotkeys in my scripts to whatever best suits your needs! It's extremely simply to do 
# Enjoy!
